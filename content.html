<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Atomic Learning platform is designed to foster a culture of contribution and collaboration among its users. By working together to build a comprehensive library of resources, users can share their knowledge and expertise, ultimately enhancing the learning experience for everyone involved. It also provides a central resource within Imperial that anyone can use for their own learning, empowering learners. It is also available for educators to use for teaching, reducing duplication of effort across the university and providing a ready-made collection of learning resources.</p>

<h2>Creation</h2>

<p>The creation of new content is a collaborative process that encourages input and feedback from the community. Anyone with suitable knowledge and experience is invited and encouraged to contribute to the Atomic Learning platform. Most often, this will include the creation of new pieces of content. Often, these pieces of content will use existing pieces of content as prerequisites. When creating new content, care should be taken to make sure that it does not repeat existing content, is of a high quality, and follows the design practices and philosophy of the platform.</p>

<h2>Iteration</h2>

<p>It is expected and desired that content on the platform will be iterated and updated over time. Contributors are invited to review and improve existing content, correcting any inaccuracies and enhancing the overall quality. This collaborative approach ensures that the platform remains a valuable resource for all users. This also means that a creator of a page should expect for their work to be iterated over time - this is a natural part of the content lifecycle on the Atomic Learning platform and engagement of this sort with their content highlights rather than diminishes the value of the original creator's contribution.</p>

<p>To support iteration, care must be taken when creating content to ensure it is in a format that can be readily iterated, and that all relevant information and materials are included to help future collaborators.</p>

<h2>Recognition</h2>

<p>Contributors to the Atomic Learning platform play a vital role in its success, and their efforts should be acknowledged and celebrated. A contributor who makes substantial contributions to a piece of content may be noted as an author of the page. Contributors are invited to submit information for their Author page, which will showcase their contributions and may optionally link to institutional profiles, personal websites, LinkedIn profiles or GitHub profiles.</p>
